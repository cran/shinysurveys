A data frame with 54 rows and 6 columns:
\describe{
\item{question:}{The question to be asked.}
\item{option:}{A possible response to the question. In multiple choice questions,
for example, this would be the possible answers. For questions without
discrete answers, such as a numeric input, this would be the default option

\item{input_id:}{The input id for Shiny inputs.}
\item{dependence:}{Does this question (row) depend on another?
That is, should it only appear if a different question has a specific value?
This column contains the input_id of whatever question this one depends upon.}
\item{dependence_value:}{This column contains the specific value that the dependence
question must take for this question (row) to be shown.}
\item{required:}{logical TRUE/FALSE signifying if a question is required.}
